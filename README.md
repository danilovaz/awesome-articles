# awesome-articles
> A curated list of awesome articles for devs

A collection just for articles. Why just for this? Already exists one billion awesome lists, what is the purpose?

Well, because I need a place where I can find relevant articles. And I need to do this in a quick way and practice.

So if you identify with the purpose and usefulness of the list, contribute :)

**Important:**
Most articles that I will list here will be in portuguese, but you can add items from any nationality. For that I'm wanting to use standard flags, such as flags of emoji. But emoji, does not have many flags (not sure why), so I will see a way around this and if anyone has any idea, please let me know :smiley:

For now, articles in portuguese I will set with Spain flag. Don't ask me why :sad:
